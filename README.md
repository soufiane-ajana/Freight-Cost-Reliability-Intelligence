Freight Cost & Reliability Control Tower
Project Overview
This advanced Power BI dashboard provides a 360-degree view of freight logistics, designed for Supply Chain Managers to monitor carrier performance, transport costs, and operational risks. The project focuses on cost efficiency and the impact of external variables (weather, vehicle types) on delivery reliability.

Key Technical Features
AI-Powered Diagnostics: Integrated Key Influencers visual to automatically identify the root causes of delivery delays (Weather, Partner efficiency, etc.).

Advanced ETL & Data Modeling: Created unique logistics tracking IDs using Power Query M-code and built a robust Date Dimension for seasonality analysis.

Complex Data Visualization: * Decomposition Tree for deep-dive cost exploration.

Heatmap Matrix to correlate weather conditions with vehicle performance.

Ribbon Charts to track the market share evolution of delivery partners.

Geospatial Intelligence: Regional mapping of delay rates to identify infrastructure bottlenecks.

Business Insights
Weather Resilience: The analysis quantifies the exact impact of "Foggy" and "Rainy" conditions on delivery SLAs, allowing for better buffer time planning.

Carrier Scoring: The "Performance Scorecard" reveals which partners provide the best value (Cost per KM vs. Rating), enabling data-driven contract negotiations.

Cost Allocation: Identified high-cost/low-weight inefficiencies in specific regions, leading to potential savings through vehicle optimization.

Tools
Power BI: DAX, AI Visuals, Power Query.

Dataset: 25,000+ freight transactions.
